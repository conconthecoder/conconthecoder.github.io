								<h4>Notes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Education is getting better, important but it is still only good for the rich private school individuals <br />
                                    Medicine is getting better but it is still an L (killed father George) <br />
                                America wants to get as good as other European Nationos <br />
                            America Industrializes and gets a w economy (at least in the North) with the introduction of steamboat, cotton gin, factories, and interchangable parts </li>
									<li>Jefferson was small government, people's man <br />
                                    He was for less government spending and less government, but he still defended country (barbatos pirates)</li>
									<li>Lewis and Clark have fun adventures, and America wants to go westward <br />
                                    They cop the Louisiana purchase from Napoleon/France, who gave up on trying to expand in America <br />
                                Aaron Burr and Hamilton have beef, and in 1804 Burr just shoots him the end</li>
									<li> Britian and France have beef - try to annoy each other at sea and also with trade tarrifs <br />
                                        America fought back with a embargo (trade war stuff) did bad for them <br />
                                        The British navy is an L, so most just ditch and go to American army <br />
                                        America wants to cop Florida, ready for a war with Britian <br />
                                        Napoleon attacks russians (rip), so no more France (in this battle) and the Americans and the British Run it back
									</li>
									<li> Andrew Jackson (actual) goes crazy, gets popular because he litterally goes rambo mode (kills 700 British, 500 prisoners, and 1,400 wonded, while only losing 8 men). Jackson will make a reapperance <br />
                                            Britian was tired so they end up giving up <br />
                                            America is taking an economic L after the war, so they create stuff - the second national bank and the National Road. <br />
                                            People start moving west (not quite Manifest Denstiny time yet), do a lot of fur trapping
									</li>
									<li><b>Federalists officially go away now.</b> They are like an iphone 6: Good at their time, but outdated and too centrilized and still<br /> 
                                        Missisouri wanted to become a state, but it would upset the slave versus free states, so They just decided to add a second state, Maine, to keep it balanced (this happens a lot) <br />
                                        The era of good feelings, followed by the Panic of 1819 were farmers copped land they couldn't afford</li>
