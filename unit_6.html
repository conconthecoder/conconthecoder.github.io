								<h4>Notes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Two party system exists because if there is only one party then no one is going to win majority of the votes <br/>
                                    New Parties are the Democratic-Republican (Democrat) and Republican </li>
									<li>Sectionalism is the ideal the State should have more power, so the nullification rule (which sucked) said that the state has the final say in everything <br />
                                    This is bad because if the government needs to get taxes or something that is important, the state can just say nope. That is why Nationalism, or the idea of the central government, is better.</li>
									<li>The removal of the Indians was known as the <b>Trail of Tears</b> The Americans wanted to move westward, and since the Native Americans were in the way they offered them to move or to fight and die<br />
                                    This was implemented through the first election of 1789 where Georgey Worgey takes the W  </li>
									<li> Jackson did not like the bank system <br/>
                                        He believed in hard money, which meant that more power to the government and less to the banks (the bank currency is fake and thus 'soft money', only government ones count) <br />
                                        The instance which he vetoed the bank was when it wanted to finance a road that would only benefit Kentucky. <br />
                                        Jackson ends up destroying the bank
									</li>
									<li> The Whig party is created to create Democrats and Whigs, because of Andrew Jackson (he is the 'king' so the whig party, like the Whig party in Britian, was against him) <br />
                                        The Whigs were similar to their predecessors, the Federalists, in that they wanted a <b>centralized</b> and commericilaized party
									</li>
									<li>Van Buren (Republican) follows, and he doesn't have the same charisma like Jackson but ends up failing because of excessive land debt from farmers <br />
                                        Then William Harrison (Whig), supported by the <b>penny press</b>, which is mass media, but he died after one month and the vice pres was actually an imposter </li>
