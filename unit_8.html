								<h4>Notes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>The South's economy focused on agriculture - they intially relied on Tobacco, but it overused the land and therefore was replaced by cotton, particularly <b>Short-Staple cotton</b> <br />
                                    South didn't progess technologically, because they thought that their agricultural system </li>
									<li>Slavery was not initially racial, but over time because the majority of slaves were black the stereotypes progressed <br />
                                        Slavery got so big in America because the conditions for life were better than in the Carribean south</li>
									<li>Varied as they focused on <b>Romanticism</b>, which was focused more on nature rather than reason, like the Englightenment <br />
                                        Promoted Westward expansion</li>
									<li> Education - Very Big W. The government focused on education infrastructure, funding, and emphasis (longer school years)
                                        Religion - W. The christians believed in self improvement, specifically going against alcohol.
                                        Science - L. The practices were still illogical, but they did teach people to wash their hands 
                                        Womans Rigths/Black rights - Meh. They were eventually given, but there wasn't too much traction in the 50s.
									</li>
									<li> Abolitionist movements did not get that much traction in the beginning, because the Northerns were scared of the conflict that could happen <br />
                                        Free soil - get rid of black people altogether.
									</li>
									<li>How to contextualize (not content based) <br />
                                        Write in respect to what was going on at that time, emphasize (understand) not symphathize (agree) <br />
                                        Don't come across as too judgemental</li>
