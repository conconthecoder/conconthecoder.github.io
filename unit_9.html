								<h4>Notes</h4>
								<ol>
									<li>Manifest destiny - the desire to move westward - was done by individiuals who wanted either to mine or to farm  <br />
										Texas was annexed and became independent in 1836; America did not make Texas a state to avoid growing conflict with slave and free states (it would make it unbalanced)</li>
									<li>The cause of the Mexican American War was that America wanted more territory, so they claimed California, Texas, and New Mexico <br />
									Also claimed Orgen from the British</li>
									<li>Popular sovereignty - the concept that states would decide whether they would become free/slave states <br />
										Clay's compromise of 1850 - slave trade was banned but slavery was still allowed, California was admitted a free state, and creating unorganized Mexico territory</li>
										
									<li> The Whig party fell out, and was replaced by the Republican party. <br />
										The Bleeding Kansas was the result of increasing tensions over slavery, what convinced the Northerners to support the Republican party
									</li>
									<li> Dred Scott v Sanford - L for antislavery, because slave Dred Scott couldn't get freedom because he was considered property <br />
										Kansas becomes a free state - the government said it shouldn't, but all of the people didn't want it so they win <br />
										Abraham Lincoln starts to get into debate, winning over people with his moral views, ends up winning presidency.
									</li>
									<li> LEQ (Long essay question) - Make sure to include adequate evidence, conclusion is not neccessary but it helps </li>
